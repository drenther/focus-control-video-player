# focus-control-video-player

This repo is part of the tutorial article for creating a smart media player with react.

A simple video player that plays when the tab is active and pauses when it is not.

The article uses ideas from this amazing article about [Page Visibility API](https://stereologics.wordpress.com/2015/04/02/about-page-visibility-api-hidden-visibilitychange-visibilitystate/) and make the implementation sit good with React.
